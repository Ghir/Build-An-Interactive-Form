# JS-Project-3---Build-An-Interactive-Form


The program provides interactivity to a web form when registering for a conference. When the form first loads, the first textfield is highlighted. As the user makes selections in the form, parts of it are automatically updated. As the user registers for activities at the conference, the total cost is highlighted below the list and when they select an activity that conflicts with the time of another one, the conflicting one is grayed out. They can pick different payment options and based on what they select, a different message will appear at the bottom of the page. Finally when they submit the form, if they haven't provided all the necessary information error messages will appear letting them know what they got wrong.
